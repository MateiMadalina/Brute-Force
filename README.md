# Brute Force

Brute Force++ is a Java project designed to explore brute force attacks on passwords stored in an SQLite database. Through this project, various aspects of Java programming are covered, including database connectivity, password generation, and brute force algorithms. It simulates a brute force attack on user credentials stored in an SQLite database, employing a combination of database operations, password generation techniques, and brute force algorithms. The project aims to analyze the effectiveness of brute force attacks on passwords of varying lengths, ranging from one to five characters.

## Features

- **Database Inspection:** The project enables the inspection of the SQLite database using the DB Browser for SQLite application.
- **Password Generation:** Randomized passwords are generated using a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers.
- **User Generation:** Users with randomized passwords are generated and stored in the database.
- **Authentication Service:** An authentication service is implemented to verify user credentials against the database.
- **Brute Force Algorithm:** The project includes a brute force algorithm to crack passwords stored in the database.
- **Attack Result Storage:** The results of the brute force attack are stored in a separate database for analysis.

## Additional Notes
- The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of brute force attacks and the importance of strong password policies.
